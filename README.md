## 🌐 Project Summary

This project presents a novel AI governance concept: **Blind-Chain Multi-Agent Governance Architecture (BCMAG)**. The core proposal includes:

- Multiple AIs control and monitor each other in a circular structure  
- No single AI knows who is controlling it  
- Creates a blind, closed-loop governance chain  
- Humans retain ultimate control and supervision

---

## 🧠 Concept Highlights

- Inspired by checks-and-balances, black-box systems, and political separation of powers  
- Each AI agent is limited in its function and unaware of its supervisor  
- The design prevents any AI from acquiring full-system dominance  
- Only humans understand the entire control structure
